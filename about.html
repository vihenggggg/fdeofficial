            <h4>History</h4>
                <p>The National University of Management (NUM) was founded in 1983 as the Economic Science Institute 
                (ESI), and received assistance from the National Economics University of Hanoi, Vietnam until 
                1991. With the opening up of Cambodia to the international community during early 1990s, the ESI 
                was renamed to the Faculty of Business (FOB), which supported by Asia Foundation and then USAID 
                (1994-1997). In 1998, the FOB was transformed into the National Institute of Management (NIM), 
                and from 2004, the NIM was renamed into the National University of Management (NUM).
